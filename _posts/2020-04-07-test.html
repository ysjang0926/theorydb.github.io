## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


{% highlight r %}
library(plotly)
{% endhighlight %}

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:


{% highlight text %}
Error in loadNamespace(name): there is no package called 'webshot'
{% endhighlight %}

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
